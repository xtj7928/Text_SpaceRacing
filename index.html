    <h1 align="center">From the Space Race to the International Space Station——human's voyage among the stars</h1>
    <p align="left" style="font: size 25px;">On October 4, 1975, with the huge fire generated by the rocket, the first artificial satellite in human history "Sputnik 1" was sent into space. The small metal ball, weighing just 83 kilograms, carried a thermometer and two radio transmitters. Its structure is so simple that its function is limited to informing Earth of changes in air pressure and temperature in space. From now on, it looks like a toy. The day after the successful launch of the satellite, a news bulletin titled "Artificial Earth satellite opens a new era of interplanetary navigation" was sent out to the world. The source of the information at the bottom of the news report deeply stung many people because it read "TASS News Bulletin".</p>

    <h2>The Race start</h2>
    <p>In 1945, humanity officially entered the age of nuclear weapons, and the ability of the atomic bomb to destroy heaven and earth shocked the world, especially the next potential adversary of the United States, the Soviet Union. 1949 The Soviet Union successfully tested an atomic bomb. In October 1952, the United States tested a hydrogen bomb to outmaneuver the Soviet Union. But just over a month later the first Soviet hydrogen bomb exploded.</p>
    <p>But while both countries have bombs in their hands, they face a huge problem: how to throw them at each other's heads. So the liquid rocket was the common choice. The United States and the Soviet Union decided to develop large liquid rockets.</p>
    <p>On both sides of the Iron Curtain, a scientific team led by Soviet scientist Koromuv and former German scientist von Braun began to focus on publicizing the new technology.</p>

    <h2>Us-Soviet cooperation</h2>
    <p>Interestingly, in May 1972, President Richard Nixon and Leonhard Brezhnev, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, negotiated detente, a short-lived "rapprochement" of the Cold War. Under the influence of sportsmanship, cooperation was more conducive to timing than competition, and the concept of continuous competition began to fade.</p>
    <p>The two countries planned a joint mission to dock the last American Apollo spacecraft with Soyuz, named the Apollo-Soyuz Test Program. In preparation for the mission, the United States designed the Apollo docking module to match the Soviet docking system, allowing any two of its spacecraft to dock. The docking module acts as an airlock, allowing the flight crew to enter other spacecraft with incompatible cabin airflow.</p>
    <p>On July 15, 1975, at 12:20 UTC, Soyuz 19 was launched for the first time and the cooperative mission began. Six and a half hours later, the Apollo spacecraft with the docking module launched. At 16:19 UTC on 17 July, the two spacecraft met and docked. The United States and the Soviet Union each sent three and two astronauts on cooperative missions, shaking hands, exchanging gifts and visiting each other's spacecraft.</p>

    <h2>influence</h2>
    <p>The United States, worried that it was falling behind the Soviet Union in the space race, pushed it further by lawmakers and educators putting more emphasis on math and physical sciences in American schools. To achieve its goals, the National Defense Education Act of 1958 increased funding from childhood through graduate school.</p>
    <p>Scientists educated under these grants help develop technologies that are used in kitchens, transportation systems, sports, and other aspects of modern life. Dried fruits and ready-to-eat foods (especially food sterilization and packaging technology), clothes that stay dry, and even fog-free ski goggles all come from space technology.</p>
    <p>Today, there are thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, transmitting communications data around the planet and providing remote sensing data on weather, plants and human activity to the countries that use them. In addition, many of the micro-technologies that fuel activities in everyday life, from timekeeping to listening to music, were initially driven by the space race.</p>
